1. .unwrap() and .expect() should be avoided unless one of the following exceptions are met
  - It is top level file where the error has bubbled up to
  - It is a test file
  - You are in the codegen module and the .unwrap will only be triggered if the code is wrong. Ie. By the time you get to codegen sematic correctness is guaranteed
2. Division of responsibilities amongst the modules
  - Lexer: Takes raw code and transforms it into tokens. Should be "dumb", meaning it does minimal actual parsing logic
  - Parser: Takes tokens and constructs the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which allows codegen to understand the sematic meaning. It also verifies program correctness, but there is not a standalone sematic analysis module, instead it does those checks at the relevant points, like it will verify variable declarations contain let, when it is creating the TBox nodes or that the condition for an if statement is boolean during that expressions parsing
    - Boxer: Takes the token stream and constructs a "pseudo ast" where all statements are resolved but expression are left in their tokenized forms
    - Ast_gen: Takes the TBox stream and resolves the expressions. It emits the AST which has all statements and expressions fully parsed. If ast_gen exits with Ok, then the input code was valid toy_lang.
  - Codegen: The codegen module take the AST generated by the parser and emits an executable (.so/dll/.a is not supported yet)
    - TIR: TIR Stands for Toy_lang Intermediate Representation and is an intermediate form between the AST and llvm. TIR is SSA and follows most of the same conventions and structure as LLVM IR to make converting easy. It exists to make the CTLA module easier. TIRGEN Module has two parts, the ir.rs file which contains the IR builder and type definitions, and the mod.rs which converts the ast -> tir
    - CTLA: CTLA stands for Compile Time Lifetime Analysis, which is the process of statically determining the lifetime of each heap allocation and inserting a call to the correct toy_free variant at each of its possible end points. It is important to note that the theoretical implementation of CTLA described here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_hYu1x2cCIjHGfZZDE_Q7D1UXYlUDxjKiVNH04I-fU/edit?tab=t.0 is not fully implemented. The current version does not deal with aliasing, structs well, multi dimensional arrays well, and crucially frees are inserted at the end of the block instead of at the exact right time.
    - LLVM: LLVM is the final codegen module where TIR is converted to LLVM IR using Inkwell. This module will also resolve and compile dependencies.
    - Linker: Invokes the version of LLD stored in the lib directory to produce the final executable. Will be replaced with a custom linker some day.
  - Misc
    - setup_build_system.py: Is a script that is run when you first download the git repo. It downloads all the dependencies and sets things up. Is currently a little bit broken
    - /src/c: Contains All of the low level c code, builtins.c contains most of the base functions like println and builtins.h most of the structs. Stub.c contains the entry point for the produced executables /src/c/ctla contains the debug allocation tracking logic and /src/c/std contains the functions used by the standard library
    - /std: Contains the toy lang standard library, right now only std.math and std.sys are implemented. math contains most of the LIBM functions and sys has some control stuff (exit, abort, panic) as well as system information like core count, os name, toy lang version etc....
3. Tests
  - Use THEM!!!! If you are ever implementing a new feature, and there is not already at least one unit test, write one BEFORE you write the code.

4. Style
  - Use standard rust-fmt style
  - Comments should be kept to an absolute minimum, if the var/func names dont explain it well enough, rename them
  - Dont remove my comments
  - Doc comments on struct fields are a good idea especially on what is k and v for a hash/btree map, ie in a string->string map, that could be anything, specify var name to source code for example
  - Dont be shy about adding to the ToyError enum, errors should be specific
