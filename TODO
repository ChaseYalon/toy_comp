Boxer will modify expressions like foo.bar() into bar(foo) which it should not
Lexer does some parsing shit around structs
Add .get_literal method to ast and boxer nodes so I dont have to pattern match every time I want the literal
Also TIR Builder assumes correctness which I am not sure I like
Lexer is to heavily involved and will do parsing logic to resolve struct types
